## Getting Started

Possible ways of hacking a website :
<br><br>
-- Code execution or file upload vulnerability : only allow users to upload files of non executable and secured formats like pdf .
<br><br>
-- Sql injection : check here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jKylhJtPmI and here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciNHn38EyRc
<br><br>
-- Cross site scripting : check here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5l9lSnNMxg
<br><br>
-- hacking the server : This can be done by finding exploits on the open ports of the server on which the website is stored . First do information gathering using tools like nmap and then try finding exploits for the services on the open ports using tools like metasploit.
<br><br>
-- client side attacks : This is the final stage when a hacker can't hack using any of the above methods. check a tutorial here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrqexzfPuK8
