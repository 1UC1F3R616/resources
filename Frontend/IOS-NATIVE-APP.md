With the power of Xcode, the ease of Swift, and the revolutionary features of cutting-edge Apple technologies, you have the freedom to create your most innovative apps ever.

Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS and beyond. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.

## Get Started

For developing native iOS apps, a major pre-requisite is a Mac. So, if you have one, go ahead and master this domain.

iOS apps are written in **Swift**. Swift is language developed by Apple itself. You can start learning swift from [official docs](https://swift.org/documentation/) or [here](https://codewithchris.com/learn-swift/).

Apple's official docs for learning to develop for their platforms is pretty good and can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/).
