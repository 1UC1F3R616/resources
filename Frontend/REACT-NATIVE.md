React Native is an open-source mobile app framework created by Facebook. It can be used to develop apps for Android, iOS and web. It allows users to write apps using the React library, giving it native platform capabilities.

## Companies that use React Native :computer:
AirBnb, Instagram, Discord, Myntra, Uber Eats, SoundCloud, and many more.

## Topics to Cover :books:

We recommend [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSRrxpdMpVc) for getting started with the basics. And after this, if you want to take a deeper dive into React Native, we recommend [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/).

The following topics should be covered: 

|S.No.|Topic|
|----|-----|
|1.|Basics of React|
|2.|Difference between React Native CLI and Expo CLI|
|3.|Setup the App|
|4.|Getting familiar with JSX|
|5.|React Components (with and without Hooks)|
|6.|Views|
|7.|Basic React Native components|
|8.|Reusable Components|
|9.|Component Lifecycle|
|10.|Navigation between screens|
|11.|State management with and without Redux|
|12.|Flexbox for styling|
|13.|Networking in React Native|

These are the basics for getting started with React Native. The recommended Udemy course goes a lot more in depth.

## Cool Project ideas :muscle:

While learning, it is always recommended to implement your knowledge practically. So, these are some project ideas to help you through this process.

- ToDo App
- Expense Tracker App
- Recipes app
- Radio/Music App
- Instagram clone (complete with a backend if you are feeling confident)

## Done? :disappointed_relieved:

<!-- Hopefully if you have completed the React Native path, you can call yourself a React Native app developer. If you are looking for more, get into [Flutter](./FLUTTER.md), which is another app development toolkit. -->
If you have gone through the resources faithfully and completed some projects, give yourself a pat on the back. You can now call yourself a React Native developer.

If you want to explore the path of app development further, look into [Flutter](./FLUTTER.md), which is Google's app development toolkit.

We hope you now know the full roadmap for becoming a React Native developer. Best of luck for your future!
