# Beginners Guide for Competitive Coding

One must have basic idea and clear concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms before diving into this sport called "Competitive Coding".

And before getting started, have a look at this site- [CP-Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/), it is a one stop solution for all competitive coders and would be very helpful at the later stage of this journey.
