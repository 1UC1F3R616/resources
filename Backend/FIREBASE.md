![Firebase-icon](https://firebase.google.com/images/brand-guidelines/logo-standard.png)  
Firebase is a collection of a set of services running on googles servers, that allow users to develop apps without managing infrastucture for the APIs. It provides 
many services like Authentication, Database, Storage, ML-Kit and much more.  

## Starting With Firebase  
To create a new project, head over to their [website](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. After that you can add Firebase to any platform 
of your preference [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup), [iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) or [Web](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

## Topics to Cover  

Firebase has great [Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs) that are easy to follow along. Below are the main topics that are useful for development via firebase.

|S.No.|Topic|
|---|---|
|1.|Authentication|
|2.|Real-Time Database|
|3.|Cloud Firestore|
|4.|ML Kit|

##  Is that it?  
Well no, but actually yes. If you want to develop a basic application, chances are that these topics are all you are gonna need, but firebase has more in store. 
The ML Kit mentioned above is quite vast. It allows you to inegrate useful ML tools in your app like text recognition, barcode scanning, image labeling, face recognition, object detection 
and much more. Recently with Android 10 they added smart replies, they too can be used via this ML Kit. Another use for firebase is [Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging),
this can be used to intgrate notifications in your app and much more.
